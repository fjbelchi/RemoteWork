# Books

#### Remote : Office Not Required
>As an employer, restricting your hiring to a small geographic region means you’re not getting the best people you can. As an employee, restricting your job search to companies within a reasonable commute means you’re not working for the best company you can. REMOTE, the new book by 37signals, shows both employers and employees how they can work together, remotely, from any desk, in any space, in any place, anytime, anywhere.

#### Remote Work Handbook

>The Remote Work Handbook offers insight into how you can make the most of virtual work through a collection of interviews from employees around the globe.

>Learn about the tools you can use to stay connected and how to manage work as an employee working from home, the road, and yes, even an island.

#### Reinventing organizations

>A fascinating read about the shift toward a new way of doing business—a way that focuses on autonomy, wholeness, and purpose in the decisions we make and the way we structure our organizations. It’s been called a “soulful revolution,” and having experienced it for the past few months here at Buffer, it’s been hugely edifying, encouraging, and rewarding.
